Prioritizing them requires a structured approach. Let's break it down using a framework common in strategic decision-making:\n\n**1. Define the Problem:**\n\nBefore prioritizing, can you clearly articulate the central problem or decision facing Medi-Displays? What exactly does George Robson need to recommend to Matthew Tullen?  Let's ensure we're on the same page regarding the core issue.\n\n**2. Identify Objectives:**\n\nWhat are Medi-Displays' primary goals? What does success look like for them in this situation? Consider both short-term and long-term objectives.  Think about profitability, growth, market share, and reputation.  Are there any explicit or implicit objectives revealed in Matthew Tullen's instructions to George Robson?\n\n**3. Analyze Each Factor:**\n\nOnce we have a clear problem definition and objectives, we can analyze each factor:\n\n* **Financial Implications:** This requires quantifying the potential profit or loss of each option (maintaining the contract, renegotiating, or walking away). We need to consider both the immediate and long-term financial impact.  Exhibit 1 and 2 provide crucial data for this analysis. Don't forget to consider the impact of volume on fixed costs per unit.\n* **Strategic Relationships:** How important is the relationship with Pharmacy Mart to MDI's future? What are the potential risks and rewards of jeopardizing this relationship? Could gaining Drugs Plus as a customer offset the potential loss of Pharmacy Mart's future business? What about the long-term implications of prioritizing short-term gains? How might this decision affect MDI's reputation and ability to secure future contracts?\n* **Operational Constraints:** Can MDI realistically meet the increased production demands if they accept Pharmacy Mart's proposal and secure additional clients? What are the potential bottlenecks? What are the implications of Carl Shuster's comments about production capacity and labor shortages?\n\n\n**4. Evaluate Trade-offs:**\n\nEach potential decision will involve trade-offs. Accepting Pharmacy Mart's proposal might damage a key relationship but open doors for new business.  Maintaining the current contract might limit growth but ensure stability. We need to explicitly outline these trade-offs.\n\n\nBy working through these steps systematically, we can develop a well-supported recommendation for Medi-Displays. Let's begin with step one: Defining the Problem. Can you articulate the central problem facing the company?\n",

What are their goals, both in the short-term and long-term?  Consider these prompts:\n\n* **Profitability:**  Is maximizing short-term profit the only goal, or is long-term profitability and sustainable growth more important?\n* **Growth:** Does MDI have aspirations to expand its market share and customer base? How does this decision impact potential growth?\n* **Customer Relationships:** What value does MDI place on long-term customer relationships versus transactional sales?\n* **Market Position:** Does MDI want to be seen as a premium, high-quality provider, or a more competitive, price-driven supplier?\n* **Risk Tolerance:** Is MDI risk-averse or willing to take calculated risks for potential higher rewards?\n\nRemember to refer back to the case itself.  Matthew Tullen's instructions to George Robson offer some clues about MDI's priorities.

Dropping the exclusivity clause might align with an aspiration for broader market reach, but only if it aligns with profitability.\n\nCustomer Relationships: The 15-year relationship with Pharmacy Mart holds strategic value. MDI likely values long-term relationships over transactional sales, as these provide stability and predictability.\n\nMarket Position: MDI’s focus on quality and dependability, as reflected in the premium features of their cabinet, suggests a preference for maintaining a high-quality, trusted brand image over becoming a price-driven supplier.\n\nRisk Tolerance: Tullen’s directive to investigate every facet of the decision implies a willingness to explore calculated risks if the potential benefits are clear and substantial.\n\nFrom Tullen’s statement, I infer that MDI prioritizes balanced decision-making—ensuring profitability while safeguarding strategic relationships and exploring growth opportunities.

We know the current revenue and costs at 120 units/year. \n2. **Renegotiate the contract:** This involves a lower price per unit but opens up the possibility of selling to Drugs Plus and independent pharmacies.  We need to calculate the potential profit at different sales volume levels, considering the lower price and potential commissions.   Remember to account for the changes in costs associated with increased volume as detailed in Exhibit 2. \n3. **Decline the request:** This might lead to losing Pharmacy Mart's business entirely, impacting profitability. We need to assess the likelihood of this outcome and the financial consequences.\n\nTo guide your financial analysis, consider these questions:\n\n* What is the per-unit profit under each scenario?\n* What are the total profit implications of each scenario, considering potential sales volumes?\n* What are the fixed and variable costs associated with each option?  How does volume impact these costs?\n* What are the break-even points for each scenario?\n\nUse the data in Exhibits 1 and 2 to perform these calculations. Start by constructing a pro-forma income statement for each scenario. We'll discuss your findings and move on to the other factors once we have a clear picture of the financial landscape.

Adjust costs based on Exhibit 2 for 600 units (volume discounts and additional fixed/variable costs) to find the cost per unit and subtract from the new selling price.\nDecline the request: If Pharmacy Mart pulls out entirely, there are no sales of cabinets.

        text: "You've made a strong start on the financial analysis, and your calculations for the \"Maintain Current Contract\" scenario are accurate. However, let's refine the calculations for the \"Renegotiate Contract\" scenario. There are a few critical elements we need to revisit:\n\n**1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) at 600 units:**\n\n* **Material Costs:** You correctly incorporated the $10/unit volume discount. However, remember that material costs are variable and should be calculated *per unit* and then multiplied by the new volume of 600.\n* **Labor Costs:** Direct labor is also variable and will increase proportionally with the volume increase. Don't forget to factor in the new supervisor's salary of $72,000 as a fixed cost addition.\n* **Plating Costs:** With the increased volume exceeding 300 units, MDI needs a new plating machine. The $120,000 cost of the machine shouldn't be added directly to the annual costs. Instead, it should be depreciated over its useful life (10 years, as per the case information regarding the initial specialized equipment investment).  This annual depreciation should then be added to the fixed costs.  Remember, plating itself is a variable cost, linked to the number of units produced.\n* **Variable Overhead:** This is also tied to production volume and needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n* **Fixed Overhead:** You correctly kept this constant.\n* **Depreciation:** This will increase with the new plating machine. You'll need to calculate the annual depreciation expense for both the existing equipment and the new plating machine.\n\n\n**2. Commissions:**\n\n* Commissions are only paid on the *additional* 480 units sold to Drugs Plus and independent pharmacies, not on the 120 units sold to Pharmacy Mart.\n\n**3. Working Capital:**\n\n* The case mentions an increase in working capital at 600 units. This is a one-time investment, not an annual expense. While important for overall cash flow considerations, it doesn't directly impact the annual profit calculation.\n\n**Revised Steps:**\n\n1. **Recalculate COGS per unit at 600 units**, considering all the variable and fixed cost adjustments outlined above.\n2. **Calculate per-unit profit** by subtracting the revised COGS per unit from the $2,650 selling price.\n3. **Calculate total profit** for 600 units, factoring in the correct commission expense on 480 units.\n\nBy revisiting these calculations with the added detail, you'll get a more accurate picture of the financial implications of renegotiating the contract.  Let's work through these revised steps together.  Feel free to ask any clarifying questions as you go.\n",

Pharmacy Mart's expansion plans could result in additional future opportunities beyond the narcotics cabinets.\nReputation: Positions MDI as a reliable, consistent partner that upholds agreements, enhancing its image as a premium, dependable supplier.\nTrust: Reinforces trust by honoring the exclusivity clause Pharmacy Mart initially requested, signaling commitment to their partnership.\nPower Dynamics: Demonstrates that MDI is not overly dependent on a single customer but still values Pharmacy Mart's business.\nAlternatives for Pharmacy Mart: Pharmacy Mart could switch to the competitor's cheaper cabinet, but the competitor's lower-quality product might dissuade them if MDI emphasizes its superior performance.\n2. Renegotiate the Contract\nLong-term Value: Opens up the potential to sell to other clients (e.g., Drugs Plus), reducing dependence on Pharmacy Mart. However, this could weaken Pharmacy Mart's exclusivity-driven loyalty, potentially limiting future collaboration.\nReputation: May be seen as a willingness to adapt and compete, but dropping the exclusivity clause could raise concerns about MDI's ability to maintain strategic commitments.\nTrust: While accepting Pharmacy Mart's request shows flexibility, it might strain trust by reneging on exclusivity, especially if Pharmacy Mart perceives this as a loss of priority.\nPower Dynamics: Shifts the dynamic, signaling that MDI seeks broader opportunities and is less reliant on Pharmacy Mart.\nAlternatives for Pharmacy Mart: Pharmacy Mart might still feel valued since MDI is meeting their price demands, but the loss of exclusivity may push them toward testing other suppliers.\n3. Decline the Request\nLong-term Value: Risks losing Pharmacy Mart entirely, which could lead to a significant immediate financial hit and sever potential future opportunities tied to their expansion.\nReputation: While declining the request could position MDI as a premium supplier unwilling to compromise on price, it might also hurt their image as a collaborative partner in the industry.\nTrust: Risks severely damaging trust, particularly after a longstanding relationship and Pharmacy Mart's role in MDI's growth.\nPower Dynamics: Signals that MDI is willing to risk Pharmacy Mart's business, but this could backfire if Pharmacy Mart shifts to a competitor.\nAlternatives for Pharmacy Mart: Pharmacy Mart might quickly switch to the competitor's cabinet, leaving MDI with limited opportunities to reclaim their business.\nInitial Thoughts\nRenegotiating the contract appears to offer the best balance of financial benefit and relationship management if executed carefully. MDI can mitigate risks by framing the renegotiation as a way to better support Pharmacy Mart while emphasizing their commitment to quality. However, MDI must ensure they don't lose sight of the long-term strategic value Pharmacy Mart brings and communicate openly to maintain trust.\n\nWhat do you think about prioritizing Pharmacy Mart’s relationship while cautiously pursuing broader market opportunities?",

Can they offer enhanced service agreements, customized solutions, or preferential treatment to offset the loss of exclusivity? Think about potential offerings beyond just the narcotics cabinet.\n* **Phased Rollout:** Could MDI offer a phased approach to opening sales to other customers? Perhaps they could initially limit sales to a smaller number of independent pharmacies or offer Drugs Plus a less favorable pricing structure to demonstrate continued prioritization of Pharmacy Mart.\n* **Contingency Planning:** What if Pharmacy Mart reacts negatively to the renegotiation despite MDI's efforts?  What alternative strategies does MDI have in place?\n\nBy addressing these points, we can refine the \"Renegotiate Contract\" option and develop a more robust action plan.
