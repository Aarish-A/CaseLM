If MDI accepts the request, the price per unit would drop below the current $4,200. While we don’t have the exact lower price yet, this reduction will directly impact revenue and, consequently, profit margins.\n\nNext, we should consider the volume of units sold. Accepting the proposal allows MDI to sell not just to Pharmacy Mart but also to other customers like Drugs Plus and independents. This means production would increase from the current 120 units to a projected 600 units annually. This jump in volume could help offset some of the lost revenue per unit due to economies of scale but also introduces additional production challenges.\n\nFrom there, we need to look at production costs. Exhibit 2 mentions that at 600 units, there are cost changes to account for:\n\nMaterial costs decrease slightly by $10 per unit due to volume discounts.\nA production supervisor must be hired at $72,000 annually.\nPlating capacity will need to expand, requiring a one-time $120,000 investment in an additional plating machine.\nWorking capital requirements will increase significantly, rising from $24,870 to $124,350 to support the larger production scale.\nAnother factor is the sales commissions. While Pharmacy Mart orders wouldn’t incur commissions, the additional 480 units sold to Drugs Plus and independents would come with a 15% commission on a selling price of $2,650, which we also need to factor into our cost structure.\n\nLastly, we should consider the operational strain on MDI’s production schedule and workforce.

Here’s my reasoning:\n\nOn the one hand, accepting the proposal would allow MDI to expand its market by selling to other customers, like Drugs Plus and independent pharmacies, which seems like a really good opportunity for growth. The projected profit of $890,772 for 600 units is a huge increase compared to the current profit of $42,607, and the profit margin jumps from 8.46% to 56.03%. That’s a pretty significant improvement.\n\nBut I’m a little worried about the risks and challenges we discussed earlier. Increasing production to 600 units requires hiring more labor and buying a new plating machine, which could strain MDI’s operations. Plus, the initial working capital investment of $124,350 might be tough to manage since it’s a one-time cash outflow, and I’m not sure if MDI has enough liquidity for that.\n\nAnother thing that makes me hesitant is the relationship with Pharmacy Mart. Even though dropping the exclusivity clause opens up new markets, it could also set a precedent for future price negotiations. What if other customers demand lower prices too? That could eventually hurt MDI’s long-term pricing power and premium positioning.\n\nSo, I guess my initial recommendation is to accept the proposal because the profit potential looks so strong, but I feel like MDI needs to be really careful about the operational challenges and risks. Maybe they should negotiate with Pharmacy Mart to ease the transition or look for financing to help manage the working capital investment.\n\nHonestly, I’m a bit torn because both options seem to have significant trade-offs.

For example, MDI could highlight the cabinet’s superior features—like the stronger lock system and thicker metal—and position it as a premium product.

This represents a profit increase of $848,165. Additionally, the profit margin improves from 8.46% under the current contract to 56.03% in the proposed scenario. These financial benefits demonstrate a substantial improvement in MDI’s profitability.\n\nFor the action plan, here are the concrete steps:\n1. Negotiate with Pharmacy Mart:\n- Frame the price reduction as a collaborative effort to support Pharmacy Mart’s growth and strengthen the partnership.\n- Propose a longer-term contract (e.g., 5 to 8 years) to lock in Pharmacy Mart as a key customer, ensuring predictable revenue.\n- Offer additional value-added services, such as faster delivery times or cabinet maintenance, to reinforce the value of MDI as a supplier.\n2. Scale Production Efficiently:\n- Address the labor shortage by implementing a targeted training program for current staff and partnering with technical schools to attract apprentices.\n- Introduce an evening or night shift to maximize the capacity of the new plating machine.\n- Explore outsourcing part of the plating process to a third-party supplier to alleviate production bottlenecks and meet delivery deadlines.\nManage Working Capital:\n3. Negotiate extended payment terms with suppliers, aiming for 60-day terms instead of the current 30 days, to reduce cash outflows.\n4. Implement a just-in-time inventory system to minimize raw material storage costs while balancing production risks.\n5. Offer early payment discounts to customers like Drugs Plus and independent pharmacies to accelerate cash inflows and support the increased working capital requirements.\n6. Expand Market Presence:\n- Develop a focused sales strategy targeting Drugs Plus and independent pharmacies, emphasizing the cabinet’s proven effectiveness in eliminating theft.\n- Differentiate the product by highlighting superior features like the advanced locking mechanism and thicker steel, positioning it as a premium security solution.\n- Use Pharmacy Mart’s success with the cabinet as a case study to demonstrate value to potential customers.",

You've quantified the financial benefits, outlined concrete steps for negotiation, production scaling, working capital management, and market expansion.  Excellent work! You've synthesized our entire discussion into a comprehensive and persuasive argument.\n\nNow, let's add one final element to make your recommendation even more robust. You've focused on the positive aspects of accepting the proposal and mitigating the risks.  However, a truly comprehensive recommendation also acknowledges the potential downsides and outlines contingency plans.\n\nWhat could go wrong if MDI accepts the proposal, *despite* implementing all the measures in your action plan? What are the key risks that remain, and what contingency plans should MDI have in place to address them if they materialize?  Let's identify at least two potential downsides and corresponding contingency plans. This will demonstrate that you've considered all angles before making your final recommendation.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        text: "One potential downside is that production delays could still occur, even with the measures in place. For example, the additional plating machine might take longer to integrate, or outsourcing part of the process may result in quality or timing issues. If MDI cannot meet delivery deadlines, it risks damaging its reputation with Pharmacy Mart and new customers like Drugs Plus.\n\nContingency Plan:\nMDI should secure backup suppliers or third-party manufacturers who can step in to provide emergency plating services if internal production falls behind. They could also create buffer stock by slightly ramping up production in the initial months to account for unforeseen delays.\n\nA second risk is that price concessions could create ripple effects, leading to margin erosion in the broader market. If other customers (like Drugs Plus or independent pharmacies) learn about the price reduction for Pharmacy Mart, they may demand similar discounts, which could undermine MDI's profitability.\n\nContingency Plan:\nMDI should segment its pricing strategy carefully. For example, the discounted price for Pharmacy Mart could be tied explicitly to its high purchase volume and long-term contract. For other customers, MDI can justify premium pricing by emphasizing product differentiation, value-added services (like maintenance), and the cabinet's proven track record. MDI should also introduce tiered pricing based on order volumes to provide incentives for larger purchases while protecting margins for smaller buyers.\n\nBy preparing for production delays and managing pricing expectations, MDI can minimize the risks associated with accepting Pharmacy Mart's proposal and ensure the business remains profitable and operationally stable.",

We broke the problem into parts—first looking at the financials, then identifying risks, and finally figuring out solutions to address those risks. This step-by-step approach made a big problem easier to handle.\n\nI also practiced critical thinking by considering trade-offs, like balancing the opportunity for higher profits with risks like production delays and pricing pressure. We used creative problem-solving to come up with specific actions, like outsourcing plating or negotiating better supplier terms, to manage the challenges.\n\nSo, I guess the key skills I developed were breaking complex problems into steps, analyzing costs and benefits, thinking critically about risks, and coming up with practical solutions.
