# CaseLM
CaseLM is a Google Gemini and [LearnLM](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/learnlm)-powered GenAI tutoring service that:

1. Teaches students to solve real-world, multi-faceted, complex problems using the [Case Method](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/news/the-case-method-at-ivey/) of learning.
2. Teaches students to work effectively in teams, develop leadership skills, and improve communication. *(coming soon)*
3. Provides actionable and strategic feedback to help students grow their skills over the short and long term

This app is meant to be a proof-of-concept demo of how GenAI can be used to help students apply their knowledge into the real world and inspire leaders that can make an impact in society, no matter who they are.

All cases are provided by the [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/) and are [publicly available](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/hba/classroom-cases/).
